//!
//! When a framebuffer is created, dropped and a new one is created, the new framebuffer doesnâ€™t
//! seem to behave correctly. At the time of #360, it was detected on Windows.
//!
//! Because this example simply creates a framebuffer, drops it and creates another one, nothing is
//! displayed and the window flashes on the screen. Run the application in a tool such as apitrace
//! or renderdoc to analyze it.
